I am a developer that has been coding for about 15 years looking to expand my knowledge on new strategies to build better systems collaboratively by taking advantage of developer-based platforms. I am aiming to increase efficiency and productivity though the use of team/project management boards and of course, also taking advantage of the features Github has to offer.

This is the second branch from the hello-world repository.
